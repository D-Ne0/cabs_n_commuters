## Problem
Write a program that takes an input file as input containing the location of m commuters and n cabs and a destination location, and outputs optimised cab routes for picking up all commuters (on a shared basis) and dropping them off at the destination.

## How to run the program
  
    python run.py <input_file>

If \<input_file\> is not given then *sample_inputs/sample_input_0.txt* is used

## Input File Format
First line contains two integers(m and n space separated), indicating number of commuters and cabs. Next m lines contain commuter locations. Next n lines contain cab locations. Last line contains the destination location.<br>
**Locations are in format: x,y**
